This folder contains concrete implementation for using contracts that are defined in ports. For example, gRPC can be an adapter with a concrete implementation that handles requests and uses an API port to access core functionalities, such as if you have an application with some functionalities and will expose it to customers. The functionalities can be CreateProduct, GetProduct, and so on, and you can expose them to the customer via REST, gRPC, and other adaptors, which will use the contracts of those functionalities, as defined in the port layer.
